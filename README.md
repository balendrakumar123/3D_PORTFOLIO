# 3D Portfolio

## Overview
This is a dynamic and interactive 3D portfolio website built using **Three.js** and **GSAP**. It showcases my projects and skills in an engaging and visually appealing manner, leveraging WebGL for rendering and smooth animations for transitions.

## Technologies Used
- **Three.js** – For rendering and handling 3D models, scenes, and objects.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – For smooth animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic and functionality.
- **HTML & CSS (SCSS)** – Structured and styled UI elements.
- **GLTF Models** – Used for loading and displaying 3D objects.

## Features
- **Fully interactive 3D environment** – Navigate through various sections with camera movements.
- **Smooth animations** – Fluid transitions between different parts of the portfolio.
- **Custom shaders & lighting effects** – Enhance the visual aesthetics.
- **Optimized performance** – Efficient rendering for smooth experience across devices.
- **Responsive design** – Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 3d-portfolio
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment
To deploy the portfolio, build the project using:
```bash
npm run build
```
Then host the generated files on **Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages**, or any static hosting provider.

## Screenshots

## Future Improvements
- **Add more interactive elements** (e.g., clickable projects, interactive backgrounds).
- **Enhance mobile experience** with better touch interactions.
- **Implement WebGL optimizations** for even smoother performance.
